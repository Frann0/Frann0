<p align="justify">
  I'm Mike Hovedskov, a passionate web application designer and developer with a focus on UI/UX Design. I specialize in creating visually stunning front-end web applications, all with my unique perspective on UI/UX Design. I have expertise in mock-ups, photo editing, image cropping, photo manipulation, and other graphic design services. I have an AP Degree in Computer Science with a top grade and I am currently waiting to start the process of getting my bachelor's degree in web design, which I hope will start in August 2023. I have been around computers my whole life and always had a curiosity for technical work. My love for programming and clean, elegant design has helped me become a professional and interactive website developer. I'm always looking to further my knowledge and utilize the latest and greatest tools available.

<h2 align="center">Some things I use</h2>

<p align="justify">During my years in this field, I have gathered a fair bit of knowledge about different tools to help further the design and development and make it easier and faster. That being said, this is only the technology I have used extensively and have build something with. Although I am generally quick to pick up new technologies given the opportunity, and I am not afraid to get out of my comfort zone as i am constantly seeking to better myself within my field of work.</p>
